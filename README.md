It's my first fullstack project made at University. 

It's a simple shop, where Users can log in, add available products to cart, then confirm purchase by making order. They also can modify amount of items in cart. 
Later, after making the order, Users can check their orders. 

User's view:

Administrators have the same options like Users, but with two new. After logging in, they can:
- add product to the store, archivize it or change quantity,
- chceck orders of all of the users.
